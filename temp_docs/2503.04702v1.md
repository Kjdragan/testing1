State-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors containing tens to hundreds of qubits have
demonstrated the building blocks for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. Nonetheless,
a fundamental barrier to scaling further is the prevalence of fluctuating quantum two-level system
(TLS) defects that can couple resonantly to qubits, causing excess decoherence and enhanced gate
errors. Here we introduce a scalable architecture for site-specific and in-situ manipulation of TLS
frequencies out of the spectral vicinity of our qubits. Our method is resource efficient, combining
TLS frequency tuning and universal single qubit control into a single on-chip control line per qubit.
We independently control each qubit’s dissipative environment to dynamically improve both qubit
coherence times and single qubit gate fidelities — with a constant time overhead that does not scale
with the device size. Over a period of 40 hours across 6 qubits, we demonstrate a 36% improvement
in average single qubit error rates and a 17% improvement in average energy relaxation times.
Critically, we realize a 4-fold suppression in the occurrence of TLS-induced performance outliers,
and a complete reduction of simultaneous outlier events. These results mark a significant step toward
overcoming the challenges that TLS defects pose to scaling superconducting quantum processors.


**I.** **INTRODUCTION**

Over the last two decades, remarkable progress has
been made toward engineering high-coherence superconducting qubit devices at scale [1, 2]. These advances
have enabled demonstrations of quantum advantage [3–
5], implementations of error-corrected quantum memories beyond break-even [6], and simulations of quantum
many-body systems [7]. However, noise continues to limit
both device performance and stability, limiting potential
demonstrations of quantum utility.
A dominant source of noise for superconducting qubits
stems from interactions with a large bath of two-level system (TLS) defects [8–10]. These microscopic defects exist
primarily within the surfaces and interfaces of materials
composing the qubits, where they can interact strongly
with the qubit’s electromagnetic field [11, 12]. When a
TLS resonance is near the qubit frequency, it can lead
to enhanced decoherence [9], a common source of performance outliers, or dropouts, in a multi-qubit processor

[13, 14]. The number of dropouts scales with the system size [14], posing a challenge for quantum error correcting codes by reducing the effective connectivity of a
qubit lattice [15, 16]. Furthermore, the noise imparted
on qubits from defects is temporally unstable [17–21], requiring frequent recalibration to suppress outliers [13].
Reliably mitigating the impact of noise resulting from
TLS defects is therefore essential for scaling superconducting circuits to larger system sizes.
Two complementary approaches have emerged in the


effort to address this challenge. The first focuses on reducing the average density of TLS defects and their coupling to the qubit. This includes materials engineering to
develop higher-quality fabrication processes [22–25] and
design improvements to reduce qubit sensitivity to dissipative interfaces [26–28]. While these efforts have successfully improved average coherence times, spatial and
temporal outliers induced by strongly-coupled TLSs continue to plague state-of-the-art quantum processors [14].
The second approach consists of in-situ control strategies to actively suppress the impact of excess TLS noise
during qubit operation. For example, the operating frequencies of individual qubits can be optimized to avoid
collisions with relaxation hot-spots caused by TLS defects [13, 29, 30]. However, this is a highly-constrained
problem with non-local scope, because the optimal operating frequencies for individual qubits must also account
for other frequency-dependent error sources [13]. Moreover, updates to the qubit frequency require additional
calibration or modeling overhead to minimize coherent
control errors, since qubit control parameters also depend on the operating frequency [31, 32]. Alternatively,
several studies have demonstrated the spectral manipulation of TLS defects using global electric fields [33–36],
global mechanical strain [33, 35–37], or other unspecified
control parameters [38]. However, since the TLS spectral
landscape varies from qubit to qubit, methods for globally manipulating the TLS spectra of many qubits with a
single control parameter are unlikely to succeed. Therefore, independent and local control over each qubit’s noise
environment will be critical for addressing the TLS problem at scale.
Here we introduce a scalable architecture for the tar_geted in-situ control of TLS and qubits (TIC-TAQ), en-_

qubit and its TLS noise environment through a single
on-chip control line. We use this novel control architecture to apply a site-specific electric field that can detune
TLSs from the qubit transition frequency and mitigate
TLS-induced noise. By dynamically manipulating the
TLS spectrum, we demonstrate robustness against excess
decoherence and show reduced fluctuations in both qubit
lifetimes and single-qubit gate errors. We use this control
architecture to demonstrate the simultaneous suppression of TLS-induced errors across 6 qubits in a multiqubit device, over a time period of 40 hours. Our approach offers a simple yet effective tool for mitigating the
damaging effects of TLS defects in a quantum processor.

**II.** **VOLTAGE-BIASED TLS DEFECTS**

While the precise microscopic origins of TLSs in superconducting qubits are unknown and many possibilities
have been suggested (Fig. 1a), the universal behavior of
these defects in amorphous materials can be described by
the Standard Tunneling Model [10, 43, 44], which treats
the TLS as a quantum system that can tunnel between
two potential wells (Fig. 1b). Here, the frequency of the
TLS is

Tunneling Model [10, 43, 44]. The potential is characterized

maintaining Purcell limited T1 times well above 1 ms (see
Appendix Sec. C for more details on the design). With
this design, a 1 V voltage bias applied on the control line
can induce electric fields |E| > 130 V/m even at the far
edge of the qubit pad, according to finite element simulations (Fig. 1c). This corresponds to a tuning sensitivity,
_γE ∼_ 4 MHz/V for a typical dipole moment pTLS ∼ 3
debye [46, 47].
We study the effect of applying a DC voltage bias on
the control line with AC Stark shift spectroscopy [19],
a variation of swap spectroscopy [9] that harnesses the
off-resonant interaction between a microwave drive and
a qubit to shift its frequency. This technique allows us
to probe the spectrally resolved lifetimes of the trans

where γ describes the coupling of the TLS to the strain
field, p is the electric dipole moment of the TLS, and ε0
is an offset that depends on the TLS’s local environment.
As a result, TLSs exhibit a hyperbolic frequency dependence when exposed to an external electric field (Fig.
1c).
With the TIC-TAQ architecture, we can realize strong
local electric fields that couple to the qubit’s TLS environment, while preserving qubit coherence, by exploiting
the symmetry of the quantum circuit. Here, quantum information is encoded in the differential mode of a floating
transmon circuit, which consists of a Josesphon junction
shunted by the capacitance between two superconducting electrodes (Fig. 1c). Fig. 1d illustrates the circuit
diagram for the transmon-control line system. The effective coupling between the control line and the differential
qubit mode is proportional to the difference, C1 − _C2, of_
the capacitances to each pad, while the coupling to TLSs
on the surfaces of the qubit electrodes is proportional to
the sum, C1 +C2. We leverage the symmetry in the qubit
structure to increase the coupling capacitance between
the control line and each electrode to ∼0.5 fF, more than
an order of magnitude larger than a typical coupling capacitance of 25 aF for a grounded transmon [45], while

mon 0-1 transition over a ∼100 MHz range and identify
individual defects that show up as dips in the T1 spectrum. Using the transmon as a TLS sensor, we sweep
the applied voltage bias on the control line over a 30 V
range. Fig. 2a shows the transition frequencies of TLS
defects coupled to an example transmon as a function of
the applied voltage bias. We observe a range of tuning
sensitivities γE between 9 MHz/V and 330 MHz/V (see
Appendix Sec. S6). We show example linecuts at the
qubit frequency (Fig. 2b) and constant voltage (Fig. 2c)
to better illustrate the response of the qubit’s dissipative
environment to the applied voltage.
Next, we examine how the target qubit is affected by
a DC voltage bias on its control line, which will also
induce an offset charge, ng, across the junction. However, the exponentially suppressed charge dispersion of
the transmon ensures that the qubit is unaffected by the
induced offset charge [48]. In Fig. 2d, we confirm that
the qubit frequency, f01 remains mostly unaffected by
the applied voltage, apart from avoided level crossings
caused by resonantly coupled TLSs. Repeated applications of single qubit Clifford randomized benchmarking
(RB) [49, 50] also show no direct dependence on the applied DC voltage (Fig. 2e), suggesting that qubit control
is not adversely affected by the DC electric field. Rather,
the applied voltage bias primarily impacts the qubit by
coupling to and modifying its dissipative environment.
The independent control of the qubit’s noise environment with respect to its intrinsic properties allows
for the unconstrained optimization of important performance metrics, including the qubit T1 time, T2,e time,
and single qubit gate fidelities. In Fig. 2f, we compare these metrics at two example voltage biases. At
_V1 = −0.15 V, where the qubit is approximately resonant_
with a TLS, we see a 60% (35%) reduction in the qubit’s
_T1 (T2,e) time compared to V2 = 3.525 V, where there_
is no resonant TLS. We also find a 35-fold increase in
the single qubit RB error when the TLS is on-resonance,
from both the reduced coherence times and coherent errors caused by the TLS-induced frequency shift. These
TLS-induced errors typify dropout qubits, which limit
quantum processor performance at scale.

**III.** **TEMPORAL STABILITY**

Next, we use TIC-TAQ to address the problem of temporal stability for superconducting qubits. TLSs do not
remain stationary, and fluctuations in each qubit’s TLS
environment are the primary driver of performance instability for superconducting circuits [17–19]. The TLS
spectral landscape for a given qubit can change drastically on the timescale of hours, due to spectral diffusion [17] or charge scrambling events [20]. When these
changes bring a strongly coupled TLS into resonance with
a qubit for a prolonged period of time, it can render the
qubit effectively inoperable.
In response to the dynamic TLS environment, we lever

Each acquisition of P1 as a function of qubit frequency takes
approximately 1 minute for a total acquisition time of approximately 11 hours. At Vb = 9 V, we see an abrupt change in
the TLS spectrum, which may be due to a charge scrambling
event [20]. b, Linecut of P1 as a function of the bias voltage.

resonance, using the two-step optimization procedure illustrated in Fig. 3a. For each time step, ti, we first
do a coarse voltage scan (-10 V to 10 V). At each bias
voltage, we perform AC Stark shift spectroscopy to characterize the TLS landscape over a small frequency window (f01 ± 5 MHz), which provides information about
nearly resonant defects. We then compute an averaged
signal P[¯]1,i(V ) over the sampled frequencies, which effectively smooths the signal over voltage. Next, we apply a
weighted average over the P[¯]1(V ) from previous iterations
to compute the loss function P1,i(V ) used to determine

an initial estimate Vi[∗] [of the optimal voltage bias. This]
reduces statistical noise and accounts for historical information regarding the TLS landscape. Finally, we refine
the initial estimate Vi[∗] of the optimal bias voltage by
measuring the qubit T1 time in a small window around
_Vi[∗]_ [and selecting the voltage that yields the highest][ T][1][ as]
_Vi[opt]. For our choice of hyperparameters (see Appendix_
Sec. F), the process of determining Vi[opt] takes approximately 200 seconds per iteration.


In Fig. 3b, we show the optimized voltages Vi[opt] over a
period of ∼38 hours, where we reoptimize approximately
once every 15 minutes. Between iterations, we evaluate
the single qubit gate errors at both Vi[opt] and a baseline
voltage, Vb = 0 V. Over the full measurement period, we
measure a mean gate error of 1.8 × 10[−][3] for the baseline
configuration, which is 2.6× larger than the mean gate
error of 6.8×10[−][4] that we find for the optimized voltages.
Moreover, at Vb = 0, we find many time periods with elevated single qubit gate errors, which we attribute to the
presence of a TLS that intermittently moves into resonance with the qubit frequency. In contrast, the single
qubit gate errors are relatively stable for the optimized
voltages.
We can quantify these temporal outliers by defining an
outlier threshold, εP,outlier, based on the distribution of
gate errors for the optimized configuration, εP,outlier =
_Q3 + 1.5 × (Q3 −_ _Q1), where Q1 (Q3) is the first (third)_
quartile and Q3 − _Q1 is the interquartile range (IQR)._
For the dataset shown in Fig. 3c, we calculate an outlier
threshold of εP,outlier = 1.26 × 10[−][3], detecting an outlier 36% (1.3%) of the time for the baseline (optimized)
configuration.
To validate that the performance improvement demonstrated by the optimizer is not simply due to the particular choice of baseline voltage, we perform a separate
experiment where we repeatedly evaluate the qubit T1
time at 51 static voltage biases (−10 V to 10 V) over a
time period of ∼22 hours. Fig. 3c shows the resulting
_T1 distributions. We find a mean T1 of 52.5 µs at the_
optimized voltages, which represents a 14% (38%) improvement compared to the best (worst) mean T1 across
all static biases. Moreover, we find a standard deviation, σdynamic = 8.4 µs, for the optimized voltages that
is at the lower end of the distribution over static biases
(σstatic ∈ [7.7, 14.4] µs) reflecting the relative stability
enabled by dynamic mitigation. The different static bias
conditions allow us to simulate the effect of independent
cooldowns, which have been shown to change the precise frequencies of TLS defects but not their overall spectral densities [21, 51]. Therefore, the clear and consistent improvement in both the average and spread of T1
times with dynamic mitigation confirms that the TICTAQ architecture can enable a reliable improvement in
qubit performance.

**IV.** **DEVICE-WIDE PERFORMANCE**

Having demonstrated the successful mitigation of TLSinduced errors on a single qubit, we now address the scalability of our technique to a large-scale quantum processor, whose overall performance can be strongly affected
by a small group of poorly-performing outlier qubits [14].
While there have been efforts to mitigate the harm caused
by such dropouts in the context of quantum error correction [15, 16], performance inevitably worsens as their
number increases. We show how TIC-TAQ can address

this problem by simultaneously mitigating TLS-induced
dropouts across multiple qubits with only constant calibration overhead.
In a multi-qubit device, each qubit couples to a separate and independent bath of TLS defects. Therefore, it
is not expected that a single voltage bias is optimal for
every qubit — a voltage bias that tunes a TLS out of
resonance with one qubit may tune a different TLS into
resonance with another qubit. This problem worsens as
the TLS spectral density or the total number of qubits increases, suggesting that local optimization of each qubit’s
individual TLS environment is necessary to maximize the
performance of a multi-qubit device.
We verify this with an experiment on 12 qubits comparing local TLS control, where each qubit’s TLS environment is controlled with a site-specific voltage bias,
and global TLS control, where all qubits share a common
voltage bias (Fig. 4a). To determine the optimal local
bias for each qubit, we perform the optimization procedure described in Section III, concurrently monitoring
each qubit for ∼26 minutes. We use the selected voltages
for each qubit from the final iteration to benchmark the
local TLS control.
Fig. 4b shows the distributions of average T1 times


(over ∼105 minutes) across 12 qubits. We compare the
distributions of mean T1 times across the device for 51
global bias values between −10 V and 10 V (grey) to
the distribution of average T1 times for the locally optimized voltage biases (dark blue). We find a mean T1 of
44.3 µs across the 12 qubits for the local configuration,
compared to a best (worst) mean T1 of 41.6 µs (34.1 µs)
for the global configurations, representing a 6.5 − 30%
improvement in mean T1 compared to all global configurations. This consistent improvement in mean T1 across
the device compared to all global configurations confirms
the advantage of local and independent control over each
qubit’s individual TLS environment.

While the locally optimized configuration led to a better average T1 across the entire device, it did not strictly
improve the T1 for each individual qubit. This can be explained in part by changing TLS landscapes, but is also
the result of DC crosstalk between a subset of the qubit
control lines (see Appendix Sec. E). Crosstalk breaks the
assumption that each control line independently controls
only a single qubit’s TLS environment, which limits the
performance of our parallel optimization method. However, this does not represent a fundamental limitation of
our method, and we expect a straightforward suppression


-----

of unwanted crosstalk with the integration of superconducting through-silicon vias in future devices [52].
As a final benchmark of the TIC-TAQ architecture,
we repeat the experiment discussed in Section III simultaneously on 6 qubits (selected to minimize crosstalk)
for a total duration of ∼40 hours. Between each iteration, we measure the qubit T1 and perform isolated single
qubit RB on each qubit at both the periodically optimized voltages Vi,q[opt] (where q represents the qubit index)
and Vb = 0 V. Fig. 4c(d) shows the time-series of RB
errors (T1 times) for a representative qubit (A5). For the
static configuration, Vb = 0 V (orange), we find a sudden
drop in the qubit T1 and a corresponding spike in the single qubit gate error beginning at approximately t = 21
hours. In contrast, the qubit performance remains stable
and unaffected by changes in the TLS spectrum when the
voltage bias is periodically optimized (blue).
For each qubit, we calculate an outlier threshold (as
defined in Sec. III) to screen for TLS-induced outlier
events. Fig. 4e shows the number of outlier qubits over
time for both voltage configurations. Over a period of
_∼40 hours, we detect one or more outlier qubits only_
8.2% of the time with periodic optimization, compared
to 67% of the time at a static voltage. Moreover, we detect no iterations with two or more simultaneous outliers
with voltage optimization, compared to 18% of the time
at Vb = 0.Finally, we compare the distributions of both
average gate error (Fig. 4f ) and average T1 (Fig. 4g) for
each of the 6 qubits over the entire experiment. We find
a 36% improvement in the average gate error with periodic local optimization (¯εP = 7.6 × 10[−][4]) compared to
the static voltage Vb = 0 (¯εP = 11.9 × 10[−][4]). Similarly,
we find a 17% improvement in the average T1 time with
periodic local optimization ( T[¯]1 = 43.3 µs) compared to
the static baseline voltage ( T[¯]1 = 36.9 µs).
These results demonstrate the advantage of using TICTAQ to locally optimize the noise environment across a
multi-qubit device and confirm that the spectral diffusion
of TLS defects is a dominant contributor to fluctuations
in qubit performance. Notably, there was no recalibration of single qubit gate parameters over the entire 40
hour time period, highlighting the qubit’s insensitivity
to the TLS control parameter.

**V.** **DISCUSSION**

In this work, we have introduced a scalable quantum
control architecture, TIC-TAQ, to address the threat of
TLS defects in a multi-qubit device. Our method enables
local and independent control over each qubit’s dissipative environment with no additional on-chip overhead,
making it simple to integrate into current superconducting quantum processor designs. Leveraging in-situ spectral tuning of TLSs, we demonstrate improvements to
qubit coherence times and single qubit gate performance
that remain robust to changes in the TLS landscape. We
also demonstrate the scalability of our method, showing


that we can simultaneously stabilize single-qubit performance across 6 qubits over a 40 hour time period, with
an overhead that does not scale with device size.
Our work represents a substantial step towards resolving spatial and temporal performance instabilities in superconducting quantum processors. Moreover, we expect
TIC-TAQ to complement and enhance other strategies
for addressing this challenge. For qubit frequency optimizers, the additional degree of freedom enabled by the
spectral control of TLS defects significantly relaxes the
constraints on viable operating frequencies. This should
enable higher performance by opening up more possible
configurations and allowing such optimizers to focus on
other sources of error. Our technique will also accelerate
efforts to reduce the density of TLS defects and better
understand their origins. Sampling qubit coherence times
over a range of applied voltages and frequencies provides
a faster method for obtaining a holistic characterization
of TLS loss, across a large-scale device. This should accelerate research on materials and fabrication processes
with faster screening and process characterization of both
test devices and full-scale processors.
Given its effectiveness and simplicity of integration,
we expect TIC-TAQ to become an important and widely
adopted tool for maximizing the stability and performance of state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors.

Transmon resonator (TIC-TAQ) feedline

FIG. S1. Device schematic. A schematic of the 16-qubit
device used in this work. Qubits A0, A7, B0, and B6 did not
survive the fabrication process and could not be measured.

Our device consists of 16 fixed-frequency transmon
qubits, each dispersively coupled to an independent λ/2
coplanar waveguide (CPW) readout resonator. The
qubits and resonators are separated into two nominally
identical groups (A and B), with each group sharing a
multiplexed readout bus. Care was taken in the design
to ensure that the qubit T1 times are not limited by excess Purcell loss from either the readout circuitry or the
TIQ-TAQ control line. However, the fabricated qubits
have Josephson energies (EJ ) that are ∼17-28 % higher
than intended, resulting in excess readout Purcell loss.
The λ/2 readout resonators are coupled to the shared
readout transmission line via an interdigitated capacitor
(IDC) such that they form an “intrinsic purcell filter”

[53]. The open stub between the IDC and the end of the
resonator is designed to be λ/4 at the qubit frequency,
_fq, so that it forms an RF short at fq. Similarly, the dis-_
tance between each IDC and the open end of the readout
feedline is also designed to be λ/4 at fq, creating an effective 2-pole bandstop filter between the qubit and the
readout input.
The device is fabricated on a high-resistivity doubleside polished silicon wafer (ρ > 10 kΩ-cm) following a
recipe based on Ref. [54]. After cleaning the wafer with
piranha at 120°C and hydrofluoric acid (HF) to remove
organics and silicon oxide, a 200 nm layer of niobium
is deposited with DC magnetron sputtering. The su

perconducting base layer, consisting of qubit capacitor
pads, CPW resonators and control wiring, is defined by
patterning a 1 µm MiR701 photoresist with a directwrite maskless aligner. The exposed features are developed for 60 seconds in MF26A developer followed by
ICP-RIE etching with BCl3/Cl2. The etch is monitored
with end point detection, and we over-etch ∼70 nm into
the silicon substrate to reduce the electric field participation of the qubit mode in the lossy silicon-air interface. The patterned wafer is cleaned in a high pressure
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) jet at 80C.
The wafer is cleaned once again with buffered oxide etch (BOE) to remove oxides before fabricating the
Josephson junctions. A resist bilayer is spun, where MicroChem MMA-EL 13 is used as the undercut layer and
AllResist GmbH AR-P 6200.9 is used as the upper layer.
The junctions are defined using e-beam lithography and
developed in n-Amyl acetate (at 0°C) for the AR-P6200.9
resist and a 3:1 mixture of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and
deionized (DI) water (at 10°C) for the MMA-copolymer
resist. The junction is deposited via a triple-angle e-beam
evaporation of aluminum films following the Manhattanstyle technique. The junctions are lifted off in acetone
at 67°C, and a gentle oxygen plasma cleaning is applied
to the devices afterward. The galvanic contact between
the Josephson junctions and the qubit capacitor pads is
formed using an argon ion-milling bandadge process [55].
The bandage is lifted-off with a high pressure NMP jet
at 80C. Airbridges are then fabricated by first patterning 2 µm MiR701 photoresist [56]. The resist profile is
smoothed out in a reflow process at 180°C to form the
bottom bridge support, and 500 nm of aluminum is deposited at 45° to cover the bridge support. The airbridges
are then finished by patterning of another layer of photoresist (MiR701, 1µm) and wet etching the aluminum
at 60°C. Finally, the fabricated wafer is diced. Chips
are cleaned by soaking in NMP at 80°C, followed by successive rinses in DI water, acetone, and IPA. Finally, the
selected chip is wirebonded to a printed circuit board and
packaged in a copper box for measurement in a dilution
refrigerator.

**Appendix B: Experimental Setup**

The packaged device is installed at the base stage of a
Bluefors XLD1000 dilution refrigerator, with a base temperature of approximately 12 mK, for cryogenic characterization. The mounted assembly is enclosed in a copper IR shield coated with Sn/Pb solder on the outside
to block and is further protected by an outer Mu-metal
magnetic shield to suppress stray magnetic fields.
The device control wiring is illustrated in Fig. C 1.
The qubit XY control and readout drive signals are directly synthesized using the FPGA-based QuBiC control
platform [57]. The resulting readout output signal is first
amplified by a TWPA, whose pump tone is generated
with a Holzworth HS9000B RF source, followed by a LNF

**Appendix C: Multiplexed Control Line Design**

In general, any capacitively coupled control line can
be used for TLS manipulation by combining a DC voltage offset with the microwave RF qubit control pulses.
However, most existing designs for qubit control focus
on engineering sufficient coupling to the qubit without
excess Purcell loss. This is typically realized by reducing
the overall capacitance between the qubit capacitor pads
and the control line, which inevitably limits the achievable TLS tuning sensitivities. The TIC-TAQ architecture
circumvents this trade-off by exploiting symmetries in
the qubit design to enable strong coupling to TLSs while
still maintaining the necessary balance between sufficient
coupling to the qubit mode and excess Purcell loss. We
describe the design considerations for optimizing such a
control line in the following sections.

**1.** **Circuit Analysis**

A lumped element circuit model of the qubit and control line is shown in Fig. C 1. The capacitance between
the floating qubit pads is Cq. The qubit junction has
a Josepshon energy EJ with a corresponding inductance
_LJ_ . The qubit pads have capacitances to the control
line C1,c and C2,c, respectively. The control line (a semiinfinite CPW transmission line) is modeled as an effective

_iωCg,c_

where Z0 = 50Ωis the characteristic impedance of the
semi-infinite CPW transmission line and Cg,c is the extra capacitance between the end of the control line and
ground. Finally, the qubit pads have capacitances to
ground Cg,1 and Cg,2, respectively. A Y − ∆transform
can be applied to the control line sub-system (teal) to
yield the equivalent circuit model in Fig. C 1 with

qubit while independently maintaining δ ≪ 1 to limit
Purcell decay.
More generally, we can view the circuit as a capacitive
voltage divider that sets the voltages V1 and V2 on the
qubit pads relative to an applied voltage on the control
line. This is particularly useful when Cg,1 ̸= Cg,2. When
the circuit is “symmetric” so that V1 = V2 the differential
qubit mode is not driven (and consequently does not decay) through the control line. From a design perspective
we can start from a circuit that is symmetric in this way
and introduce a small asymmetry to allow for qubit XY
control.
Finally, we note that the real chip design also included
the effects due to capacitance between the qubit pads
and the readout resonator. Analyzing the full circuit we
find that the capacitance to the readout resonator simply
renormalizes the ground capacitances, Cg,i → _Cg,i[′]_ [, in a]
straightforward way.

**2.** **EM Simulation**

To demonstrate the advantage of the IC-TAQ control
line design, we analyze the strength of the TLS tuning
field, ETLS, across several designs for capacitively coupled XY control lines. We perform finite element method
(FEM) electromagnetic (EM) field simulations using Ansys Maxwell. In Fig. S4a, we first show that the field of
the qubit mode Eq (Vrms ∼ 5µV) is concentrated within
a few hundred nanometers of the edges of the capacitor pads. Since the TLS-qubit coupling is proportional
to |Eq|, relevant TLS defects affecting the qubit primarily reside at these surfaces where the qubit electric field
is sufficiently strong [33, 34]. In Fig. S4b, we perform
the same simulation with the Maxwell 3D solver. Generally, 3D solvers under-perform in resolving fields at the
nanometer-scale compared to 2D solvers because they
require more computational power. For example, the
smallest mesh here is 4 nm in the 2D simulation and
800 nm in the 3D case. Still, the 3D simulation qualitatively captures the edge-concentrated distribution of Eq.
In Fig. S4c, we compare the simulation results within 2
µm of the edges of the capacitor pads and plot the relative deviation between the two solvers. We can linearly
interpolate the 3D simulation results to get nm-scale information between adjacant mesh points. The resulting
difference between the results from the 2D and 3D solvers
is at most ∼ 50% across the region of interest. As expected, the maximum deviation happens over the intermediate regime between the smallest node distance in the
2D mesh and that in the 3D mesh (2 nm < x < 400 nm).
A similar deviation is expected in the case of ET LS. As
such, we will utilize the 3D solver with a similar mesh
size to capture the geometric effects, but with the understanding that such a simulation has a limited spatial
resolution in this intermediate regime.
In Fig. S5, we investigated three different qubit designs: a the TIC-TAQ control line design in this work, b

a common floating transmon design [61], and c a “Xmon”
design [9] from Ref. [62]. To compare these designs, we
define the normalized TLS tuning strength as the ratio
_γE/gTLS, where_

_γE = 2p · ETLS/VDC,_ (C9)

is the TLS tuning sensitivity to the applied electric field,
and

_gTLS = p · Eq,_ (C10)

is the coupling strength between the qubit and the TLS.
For simplicity we choose p ∥ **Eq. Intuitively, this ratio**
represents the degree to which the qubit can be decoupled
from TLS defects, since γE determines the achievable frequency shift of a TLS and gTLS sets the frequency scale at
which a detuned TLS remains a dominant source of decoherence for the qubit. In practice, the detuning required
to completely mitigate the detrimental effects of a TLS
also depends on other properties, such as the coherence
time of the defect. Our simulation results highlight the
advantage of the TIC-TAQ design. First, the TLS tuning strength is mostly > 100 V[−][1] around the edges of the
shunt capacitor pads, reaching values > 1000 V[−][1] close to
the XY control line. In stark contrast, the floating transmon design example here shows a marginal normalized
TLS tuning strength (< 10 V[−][1]) around the edges of the
qubit pads. Since the control line approaches the qubit
asymmetrically (Cc,1 ≫ _Cc,2), the TLS tuning strength_


and the qubit mode coupling strength both scale with the
qubit-control line separation. Maintaining a low Purcell
loss rate consequently leads to a weak normalized tuning strength. Likewise with the Xmon design, there is
no symmetry that can be exploited to independently set
the control line coupling to the qubit mode relative to
the TLS tuning strength. This design shows a significant tuning strength at one end of the qubit capacitor
pad while leaving other areas only slightly tunable (< 40
V[−][1]). In summary, our EM simulations show that the
TIC-TAQ control design significantly increases both the
strength and coverage of the TLS tuning field.

Implementing the TIC-TAQ design in a 3D-integrated
(flip-chip) quantum circuit platform [63, 64] is also
straightforward. As shown in Fig. S5d, the flip-chip
geometry allows us to extend the end of the control line
between the qubit capacitor pads (along the axis of symmetry) so that it ends directly above the junction. We
note here that both the control line-induced Purcell loss
and the total qubit capacitance are chosen to be as close
as possible to the TIC-TAQ design used in this work (Fig.
S5a). The smaller qubit footprint results from the presence of the additional silicon (εr = 11.7) located above
the qubit. Fig. S5e shows the normalized tuning strength
where, compared to the planar designs, the normalized
TLS tuning strength is two orders of magnitude stronger
and covers nearly the entire area over which TLS defects are expected to couple to the qubit. This confirms
the compatibility of the TIC-TAQ architecture with 3Dintegration, which is necessary for building large-scale
quantum processors.

and 13.65 V from the fit, where the TLS spectrum exhibits a
discontinuous shift. b, A scatter plot showing the extracted fit
parameters γE (tuning sensitivity) and ∆0 (tunneling energy)
for 11 defects. Error bars indicate fit uncertainties.

**Appendix D: TLS Spectrum Fitting**

As discussed in the main text, the TLS spectrum is
unique for each qubit. Here, we fit the voltage response
of the TLS to the STM (Eq. 2), based on the example
TLS tuning spectrum shown in Fig. 2a. The extracted
STM values can provide microscopic insights into each
TLS that is coupled to the qubit. As discussed in Sec.
II, AC Stark shift spectroscopy allows us to identify individual TLS defects from dips in the P1 spectrum. After
identifying peaks in each constant voltage slice, we select
points belonging to a continuous tuning curve for fitting
to the hyperbolic model. For this particular dataset, we
were able to identify 11 unique TLS tuning curves that
we could fit with reasonable fidelity.

In Fig. S6a, we show the identified TLS tuning trajectories with their fits to the STM indicated by the black
dotted lines. The extracted tuning strengths, γE, and
tunneling energies, ∆0, are plotted in Fig. S6b, with error bars indicating the fit error. As expected, the tunneling energies are randomly scattered around the qubit frequency. We note that the limited spectral range achievable with the AC Stark effect makes it difficult to obtain
accurate fits when tunneling energy is far below the qubit
frequency. However, the detection range can be extended
by leveraging the higher transitions of the transmon. We
find that the tuning strengths for the identified TLS defects vary by more than an order of magnitude, which
can result from differences in their locations, the magnitudes of their electric dipole moments, or the directions
of their electric dipole moments relative to the applied
electric field.


**Appendix E: DC Crosstalk**

The successful simultaneous mitigation of TLSinduced noise in a multi-qubit processor requires independent and local control between each control line
and its target qubit’s TLS environment. Unwanted DC
crosstalk complicates the optimization process and increases the overhead of finding a simultaneous set of optimal voltage biases across number of qubits. We characterize the DC crosstalk in our system by simultaneously monitoring the TLS spectra of all 12 qubits with an
AC Stark shift spectroscopy measurement, while sweeping the applied bias voltage on a single control line at
a time. The results of these crosstalk measurements are
shown in Fig. S7. Of the 132 potential qubit-control line
pairs that correspond to unintended crosstalk, we see a
detectable level of crosstalk on 7 such pairs (red border).
By cross-referencing this data with the physical layout
of the device (Fig. S2), we find that crosstalk primarily occurs when a control line passes by a nearby qubit.
We attribute this to the fact that while the control line
is shielded from above by grounding airbridges, there is
no shielding from below in the silicon substrate. Consequently, we expect the straightforward integration of
superconducting through-silicon vias (TSV’s) for shielding each control line to substantially reduce the level of
crosstalk [52].

**Appendix F: Optimization Details**

Here we discuss the optimization strategy used for
TIC-TAQ in greater detail. The primary goal of the optimization procedure is to determine the best operating
voltage to apply with the TIC-TAQ control line at a given
point in time ti, where i specifies the i-th iteration of the
procedure.
For each iteration, we perform AC Stark shift spectroscopy on the qubit to characterize the TLS distribution in the spectral neighborhood of the qubit and its response to the voltage bias. We prepare the qubit in the
_|1⟩_ state, and measure the |1⟩-state population P1,i(f, V )
(after a fixed time delay) as a function of both the Starkshifted frequency f and the voltage bias V . We then
average the traces over all frequencies as,


where the normalization factor N is given by N =
�ij=0 _[W]_ [(][t][i][, t][j][).] Finally, we select the optimal voltage


_P¯1,i(V ) =_ [1]

_K_

This can then be refined with a finer voltage scan around
_Vi[∗][, as discussed in Sec.][ III][.]_
The choice of voltages V and frequencies f over which
to perform the stark shift spectroscopy scan depends on
the precise details of the TLSs that couple to the qubit
and in particular the distribution of tuning sensitivies,
_γE. For small γE, it is necessary to scan a larger voltage_
range to ensure that any TLS near the qubit transition
frequency, f01, can be tuned sufficiently far away from
the transition. For large γE, it is necessary to perform
a finer scan over voltages to ensure that no TLSs come
into resonance at intermediate voltages. This, in principle, requires scanning over a large number of voltage
points to accurately estimate the qubit’s T1 dependence


on the bias voltage. However, we can reduce the number of voltage points by measuring the TLS distribution
in a small neighborhood ∆f around f01 to detect TLS
at nearby frequencies for each voltage bias. Since the
TLS frequency is approximately linear in V for a sufficiently small voltage spacing, this has the same effect as
performing a finer voltage scan. Thus, the trade-off between scanning over frequencies and voltages is primarily
dependent on the wall-clock time of each measurement
sweep.
In our experimental setup, the voltage bias is applied
with a “slow” DC source, while the AC stark shift tone is
applied using the same “fast” AWG that implements the
qubit control pulses. As a result, there is a significantly
larger time overhead for each additional voltage point in
the sweep compared to additional frequency points. For
the experiments described in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we scan
over 51 evenly spaced voltages between -10 V and 10 V,

and 9 evenly spaced frequencies between f01 ± ∆f where
∆f = 5 MHz.
The choice of weighting function W (t, t[′]) depends primarily on the timescale of TLS spectral diffusion. In
the limit where W (t, t[′]) = δ(t − _t[′]) is the Dirac delta-_
function, the procedure does not take into account any
historical data and may be sensitive to small fluctuations
of TLS spectrum. However, this allows the optimization
algorithm to adapt more quickly to an abrupt but substantive change to the TLS distribution. In contrast,
stronger weighting of prior traces can promote greater
stability in the choice of Vi[∗] [by prioritizing voltage biases]
with consistently higher P1 values, but may be slower to
adapt to changes. For the experiments described in Fig.
3 and Fig. 4, we use a linear weighted average,

where the time constant τ was chosen to be 75 (60) minutes in Fig. 3 (Fig. 4).
While the hyperparameters used in this work were


found to work well, the optimal choice of hyperparameters for a given system has not been systematically studied and is the subject of ongoing research. This includes
alternative weighting functions, which may be analytical
(exponential weights) or empirically derived using machine learning techniques. In general, we can also incorporate more input data into the optimization procedure
for different applications. For example, we can perform
Stark shift spectroscopy on the higher levels of the transmon by preparing the transmon in the |s⟩ state and measuring the population Ps(f, V ) as a function of V and
the stark shifted transition frequency fs,s−1. Including
data from both s = 1 and s = 2 would promote voltage
biases Vi[∗] that simultaneously improve both the coherence of the |1⟩ and |2⟩ states of the transmon, which can
improve the performance of qutrit computation [65] or
two-qubit gate schemes like the diabatic CZ gate that
temporarily populate the |2⟩ state [62, 66]. It may also
be advantageous to use RB as a cost function [67], since
this can capture additional detrimental effects induced
by TLSs, such as frequency shifts or excess dephasing.
